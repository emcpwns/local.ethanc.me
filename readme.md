# Ethan's Homelab

In an effort to document my homelab better than a loose assortment of hostnames, FQDNs, and IPs in an .ods spreadsheet that I *occasionally* remember to update; I've put together this repo to help keep track of my projects.

This knowledge base is written in markdown, and is easily readable as plaintext, but browsing on Github or using a markdown reader like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is recommended for the best experience.
## Contribution

As this is my personal Homelab documentation, I don't accept any contributions.
